# **Single Linked List using Go**

##### *Bagas Adi Fathoni - June 2022*

> Linked List is a data structure consisting of a group of vertices (nodes) which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each vertex is composed of a data and a reference (link) to the next vertex in the sequence. *(visualgo.net)*

We can use Go to implement Linked List. In this repository, the Linked List **only accept string** as its type.


## Important Notes and Features
--------
### *Value must be different*
You can not create or add with an exact same value
### *Add to Head*
Using `AddToHead()` method, you can add a new value to the head of linked list.
### *Add to Tail*
Using `AddToTail()` method, you can add a new value to the tail of linked list.
### *Add after value*
 Using `AddAfterValue()` function, you can add a new value after a desired value. The function takes a linked list, a value in the linked list and value that'd be added, respectively.
### *Find a value*
You can find if there is a value in the linked list by using `FindNode()` method.
